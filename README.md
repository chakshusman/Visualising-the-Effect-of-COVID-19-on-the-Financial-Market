The collective behavior of a complex system comprising several interacting components is often
non-trivial and challenging to understand. Financial markets consist of several companies influencing
each other’s performance, in addition to the external influencing factors. We analyze the effect of the
ongoing pandemic on financial markets. We focus on the 500 companies in the S&P 500 index, which
contains companies from diverse sectors and sizes in the US. Firstly, we create network visualizations
from the correlation matrices of the stock time series to understand their collective behavior. We see
a stark transition in the pattern of correlations in the system after the pandemic ensues. We see a
community structure based on the market sectors in the network visualizing the pre-COVID market.
However, during the COVID period, a drastic change in the network structure is seen due to the
external influence of the pandemic. Mainly, in addition to an increase in the overall connectivity
of the network, we see a community structure where the affected sectors are merged into a large
community. Furthermore, we visualize different network properties– including clustering, degree
assortativity and network density– for different time periods through a sliding window analysis of
the data. Again, we see stark transitions in the visualizations after the pandemic ensues. Through
this project, we hope to gain deeper insight into the functioning of financial markets and their
response to external factors.
